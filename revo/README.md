SER - polish R user group
=========================

![ser](ser.png)
 

The first meeting of R users in Poland took place in Wroclaw in 2008. It was a one-day conference with 27 participants. 
Today we have three large groups of R users in main polish cities (according to meetup.com there is 640 users in [SER - Warsaw](http://meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/), 235 in [eRka - Cracow](http://www.meetup.com/Cracow-R-User-Group/) and  64 in [PAZUR - Poznań](http://www.meetup.com/Poznan-R-User-Group-PAZUR/)). And there are also some other data science groups that of course are full of R users anyway (450 users in Wroclaw and 115 in Łódź).

We have tried different forms of meetings. Some of them were working some of them not. Below I will try to summarize what we have learnt. 



The most common formula for our meetings is: two short talks (around 30 minutes) with 30 min break for pizza and networking. The main advantage of this formula is that it is very easy to organize. Just find a large room, order pizza and other snacks and find speakers (you can meet even without speekers, but with them is nicer). 

In Warsaw we have meetings every month. They usually start at 6pm. Currently we are using a large class room at Warsaw Technical University. We were trying pubs, coffe shops, other rooms but finally it turns out that at university we have large enough room and not that much of noise.  

Among attenders there are students, some stuff but majority of participants are graduates that are now working in business. So 6pm is a good starting time since they can join us after work. Then we finish around 8pm – good time for after party.

We have also tried hackatons (two in Warsaw, one in Cracow), which were pretty cool but also they require much more preparation and organization. But some of them result in interesting outcomes, like this diagram of [flow between parties in Poland in previous cadence of Sejm](http://smarterpoland.pl/index.php/2015/10/jak-poslowie-zmieniali-kluby/).



Talks are very diversified. Some of them are in Polish some in English, some are technical some are applied and some related to methodology. The 30 minutes per talk turns out to be enough to get people interested and ignite discussion.

One we have even try the cinema–like meetings. Together we were watching videos about deep networks, eating pizza and sharing experience related to what we have heard. It wasn't bad, but afterall it is much better to have live speaker.

After all I think that it is good to try different forms. It simply is interesting to see what is working what is not. 
The key ingredient are speakers. So I just would like to sent thanks to some of them
